# tdd-starter-ts
minimal starter config for tdd in typescript

## Known issues:

### specFilter deprecation warning

might get fixed by an update to karma-jasmine

> 'DEPRECATION:', 'Setting specFilter directly on Env is deprecated, please use the specFilter option in `configure`'

### es2017 features do not transpile

as soon as polyfills are integrated and the tsconfig is  updated, this should work
